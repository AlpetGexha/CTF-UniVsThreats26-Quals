# Where are the Universe!

A mysterious bot has docked in our server carrying a broken launch key split into four fragments. The first fragment is hidden in plain sight, a round view of something that was never meant to be round.

When the time comes, a global launch event will trigger. To ignite the engines, you must gather in the voice hangar and stand together at the shuttle. Each crew member must take a position and recite the launch chant in the correct order, a familiar tune that starts with:

This is the only phase of the challenge where you are allowed to collaborate. Coordinate in voice, then set your nicknames to assemble the chant in order, one word per person, using numbered names like:

1 FIRST
2 WORD
3 OF
4 THE
5 CHANT
...

If the chant is assembled perfectly, the next fragment will drop and the final phase of the mission will unlock.

Engines ignited - perfect chant! Part 3: \_m0n3Y_R0b0tI1

## Part 1:

We Scan the QR code from the bot on discord

`I_W1lL5Hu7`

## Part 2:

- collected 21 image from the bot
- use that image as 0 and 1 (black 1 and white 0) to decode a binary stream
- merge into matrix
- find the best combination and using PIL we make an QR code and get the flag

## Part 3:

`_m0n3Y_R0b0tI1`

## Part 4:

- Record the bot on the discord channel and use the audio to decode the final flag

- using the 2-tone FSK decoding we get the binary stream and decode it to ascii to get the final flag
