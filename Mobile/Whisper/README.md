# Whisper

**Point: 100**

A deep-space relay known as Whisper streams encrypted telemetry from orbital stations.
Your mission is to analyze the Android client and recover the access token used by the control API.
Something in the local signal path is leaking more than it should. Capture the right artifact, authenticate to the relay endpoint, and retrieve the flag.
